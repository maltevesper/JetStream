The software is documented through a lot of comments. The doxygen documentation for the userlibraries can be viewed [here](doc "cpp userlibrary documentation") or you can generate it yourself by running make doc in your build directory (see [Getting Started](gettingstarted), which will generate the documentation under userlib/cpp/doc/.

The hardware itself is outlined in our publication "JetStream: An Open-Source high-performance PCI Express 3 streaming library". Additionally there are several examples of how to embed different modules, and how to replace modules in the [hardware repositories example directory](https://github.com/maltevesper/JetStream-hardware/tree/master/examples).
