  JetStream is a PCIe library for FPGA's that comes with batteries included. While you are free to customise the hardware and replace modules with your own, getting started is as simple as installing a driver and running one of the example designs on your FPGA.
  
  We provide full [documentation](documentation) and [many examples](). We hope that we soon can reference a lot of projects using JetStream. Please [drop us a line](contact) when you use JetStream. We are happy about any feedback, feature requests or to hear about your applications.
