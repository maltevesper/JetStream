With our initial paper accepted at the [FPL 2016][fpl2016] we are currently polishing the code for release no later than our FPL talk. The cmake build system, and doxygen documentation are finished. We currently work on creating a hardmacro, documenting examples, and creating a clean git repository for public release.
